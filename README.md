My lil terminal project

*note: the terminal is designed only for debian based linux. It can be installed on nondebian distros but it is not reccomended and may cause issues. also it does not work on anything that isn't linux at all (not even MacOS)*
*ps: it was made as a test to see if AI could build a working shell by itself and it has turned to an actual project*
